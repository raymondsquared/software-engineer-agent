# Software Engineering AI Agent

## Overview
The **Software Engineering AI Agent** automates and assists across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). From planning through monitoring, it provides structured workflows, intelligent insights, and operational support to accelerate delivery while ensuring quality and reliability.

## Features
- End-to-end lifecycle coverage (Plan â†’ Monitor).  
- AI-driven recommendations and automation.

---

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Plan
- Generate project roadmaps, backlog items, and technical specifications.  
- AI-assisted architecture and design proposals.  
- Integration with issue tracking.  

### 2. Code
- Intelligent code generation with context awareness.  
- Code reviews, refactoring suggestions, and adherence to coding standards.  
- Framework-specific templates and boilerplate automation.  
- Automated PR review and security scan on pull requests.  
- Amazon Q for spec-driven development.

### 3. Build
- Automated dependency management and build pipelines.  
- AI-driven build optimisation and caching strategies.  
- Containerisation support.  

### 4. Test
- Unit, integration, and performance test generation.  
- Test coverage analysis and quality metrics.  

### 5. Release
- Semantic versioning and automated changelog generation.  
- Compliance with conventional commits.  
- Controlled rollout strategies (blue/green, canary).  

### 7. Operate
- Automated scaling and resource optimisation.  
- Use MCP (Model Context Protocols) to analyse current state and help operations.

### 8. Monitor
- Real-time observability.
- Alerting and incident management integration.
