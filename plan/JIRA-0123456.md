- Validate email format and password strength
- Duplicate email returns 409 Conflict
- Missing fields return 400 Bad Request
- Rate limiting returns 429 Too Many Requests
- All errors return a JSON object with an "error" key

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a valid email and strong password, when the user submits the registration form, then a new account is created and a 201 response is returned with the user ID.
- Given an invalid email or weak password, when the user submits the registration form, then a 400 Bad Request is returned with an error message.
- Given required fields are missing, when the user submits the registration form, then a 400 Bad Request is returned with an error message indicating missing fields.
- Given an email that already exists, when the user submits the registration form, then a 409 Conflict is returned with an appropriate error message.
- Given too many registration attempts, when the user submits the registration form, then a 429 Too Many Requests is returned with a rate limit error message.
- Given an unexpected server error occurs, when the user submits the registration form, then a 500 Internal Server Error is returned with a generic error message.
- Given the API is implemented, when documentation is generated, then the endpoint is described in OpenAPI/Swagger.
